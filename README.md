# fapotrupo
Fapotrupo is a quick hack to calculate true and false positives of RT-PCR tests. It uses Bayes Theorem and RT-PCR data from WHO (file:///home/dg/Downloads/WHO-2019-nCoV-Antigen_Detection-2020.1-eng%20(2).pdf). Since prevalence is location dependent, a vector between 1% and 20% has been chosen. 

An explanation of how Bayes Theorem works is available from Numberphile on YouTube, featuring UC Berkeley professor Lisa Goldberg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8xlOm2wPAA
