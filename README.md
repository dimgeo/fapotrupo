# fapotrupo
Fapotrupo is a short program to calculate true and false positives of RT-PCR tests used for COVID19 RNA detection. It uses Bayes Theorem and RT-PCR data from WHO https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1302653/retrieve Because prevalence is location-dependent, a vector between 1% and 20% has been defined instead of an arbitrary value. 

An explanation of how Bayes Theorem works is available from Numberphile on YouTube, featuring UC Berkeley professor Lisa Goldberg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8xlOm2wPAA 

This software is written in the J programming language. A development and runtime environment can be downloaded from http://www.jsoftware.com
